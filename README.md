Hello! I'm an aspiring technical and VFX artist.
My goal is to design and develop tools for artists to help bring creativity to the world.
I'm interested in assisting companies and collaberators to build assets within the film and gaming industries.
I currently reside near Nanaimo B.C. of Vancouver Island, Canada.

My passion began in my childhood around the release of Goldeneye 007 for the Nintendo 64. I loved analyzing how
different meshes interacted, and how textures were UV mapped to surfaces. Into my highschool days, I spent much
of my time in a creative game engine editor called Forge within Halo 3 for Xbox 360, where I would host 16 person
game lobbies. During my grade 12 year, I enrolled into VIU. Over the next 8 years, I completed a double major degree
in Computer Science and Mathematics, as well as a 2 year Japanese (æ—¥æœ¬èªž) language diploma, and a 1 year Engineering
certificate.

The best time of my life was having the privlidge to take a course in computer graphics. Drawing my first primatives
on screen was enough to bring me to tears of joy. I spent a couple hundred hours of my life working in a basement at
VIU during the dark winter nights pursueing my OpenGL projects. I loved every aspect of it all: emitters, particles,
topology, grammars, shaders, controllers, projections, mappings, algorithms, version control, and so much more.

This is my passion, and I hope to share my love with others on my way up.
